# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts
```


//* Notes for deploying the smart contract on your own subnet
//* More info on subnets: https://docs.avax.network/subnets
//* Why deploy on a subnet: https://docs.avax.network/subnets/when-to-use-subnet-vs-c-chain
//* How to deploy on a subnet: https://docs.avax.network/subnets/create-a-local-subnet
//* Transactions on the C-Chain might take 2-10 seconds -> the ones on the subnet will be much faster
//* On C-Chain we're relaying on the Avax token to confirm transactions -> on the subnet we can create our own token
//* You are in complete control over the network and it's inner workings

npx hardhat compile
